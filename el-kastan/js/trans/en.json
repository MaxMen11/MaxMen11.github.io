    "Rrules": "Each player has four numbered pieces (1â€“4) and four corresponding cards. On their turn, a player flips a numbered card and moves the piece with the same number to an empty adjacent square. After all the numbered cards have been used, they are flipped back, and the game continues as a new semi-round. Each player also has four special cards that allow for diagonal movement, moving two squares, or moving a piece to any empty square. If a player cannot move a piece, they discard it, draw a new card, and receive a penalty point. The goal is to force the opponent to accumulate four penalty points. Additionally, when a piece is discarded, the player can place it anywhere during the next round of cards, and it counts as a move.",

    "Sstrategy": "There are 4 types of opening I named so far.<br>1. The mirr-L Block: The starting player starts with the stone closest to the opponent and then \"rotates\" the other stones counter-clockwise on his board part, creating an reverse L afterwards, that's the opening.<br>2. ... <br>3. ... <br>4. ... <br>",

    "IBaseInfo":"El-KaÅ¡tan is a simple two-player, turn-based strategy game I created when I was probably 10 years old. Players move numbered pieces on an L-shaped game board and take turns. The goal is to force the opponent to accumulate 4 penalty points by preventing them from being able to move their pieces, so the game revolves around blocking and prediction. Over the years, I've played it with many friends and people, and funny enough, even though I made the game, I don't win much! ðŸ˜Š",
