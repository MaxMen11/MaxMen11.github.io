The goal is to force the opponent to accumulate 4 penalty points.</p><h2>Game Board</h2><p>The game board has an L-shape (4x4 grid with a missing 2x2 corner). Each player starts with four numbered pieces (1-4) in their respective corners, and four numbered cards. Players also have a supplementary card deck.</p><h2>Supplementary Deck</h2><p>The supplementary deck contains 4 cards:<ul><li>2 diagonal movement cards</li><li>1 two-square move card</li><li>1 card for moving a piece to any square</li></ul>Players draw cards at the beginning and can use them during their turns. Once a card is used, it is removed from the deck.</p><h2>Objective</h2><p>The objective of the game is to make your opponent accumulate 4 penalty points.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>On their turn, a player flips a numbered card and moves the corresponding piece to an empty adjacent square.
