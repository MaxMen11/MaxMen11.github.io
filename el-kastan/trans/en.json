    "IBaseInfo":"El-Ka코tan is a simple two-player, turn-based strategy game I created when I was probably 10 years old. Players move numbered pieces on an L-shaped game board and take turns. The goal is to force the opponent to accumulate 4 penalty points by preventing them from being able to move their pieces, so the game revolves around blocking and prediction. Over the years, I've played it with many friends and people, and funny enough, even though I made the game, I don't win much! 游땕",
